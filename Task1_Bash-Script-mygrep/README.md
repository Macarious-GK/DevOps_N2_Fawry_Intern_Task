### Task needed to be covered:
- Create initial version of the script as a beginning to do the simplest funcition like `find the first match` from String or file
- Update the script to `print the matching lines` from a text file 
- Enhancing visablity by adding `different color for the matching` words in the lines 
- Enable `Case sensitive` in my script
- Hard Coded option: Adding the functionality of `Showing line numbers` for each match 
- Hard Coded option: `Invert the match` (print lines that do not match)
- Implement `Flag arguments`
- Brain storming for corner cases
- Implement error handling for corner cases
- Optimize the Flags by `parsing using getopts`
